// Hand-authored: makes `doctor` report a verdict that tracks reality.
//
// Before this file existed, doctor answered "OK API: reachable" whenever the
// configured host returned ANY HTTP response to `GET /` - including a 404 from
// a wrong base URL, a 401 from a dead session, and a 200 from a vendor's
// marketing page. It also never probed the credential at all on this connector:
// it printed "present, not verified" and left the operator to guess. The mirror
// defect hit correctly-configured operators: a connector whose shipped base_url
// is a placeholder dialled the placeholder host and rendered a DNS failure as
// "FAIL API: unreachable", which reads as "your install is broken" when the real
// answer is "one environment variable is unset".
//
// The helpers here give doctor a verdict it can defend: refuse to dial a
// placeholder, probe a real read endpoint with the real credential, and classify
// the answer by status code instead of by substring.
//
// This connector authenticates with a browser cookie session rather than an API
// key, which makes the probe MORE load-bearing, not less: a cookie expires on
// the vendor's schedule with no warning to the operator, so "present" is never
// an answer to "does my session still work".
//
// See issue #282, issue #176, and skills/riverside-fm/handfixes.json.
